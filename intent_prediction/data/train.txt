2	i hope he snaps out of it soon.

5	might be worth chatting with hr to see if there are any pointers you can get so maybe next time will go in your favor.
1	oh, i would be scared too.
8	i tried not to give any advice that was too specific, because the best solution always has to come from that person themselves.

3	i hope it all works out for you.
3	yes, i hope so too.

4	i'm sorry to hear that.
8	my dogs love the outdoors but they want ac after a good, long walk!
6	what kind of prank did he pull on you?
2	i hope you get the job.
